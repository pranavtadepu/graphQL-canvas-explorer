# GraphQL Canvas Explorer

For this project, we developed a **Spring Boot command line program** utilizing **Picocli** and **GraphQL** to interact with course and assignment data via a CLI interface. The main functionality is divided into two subcommands: `list-courses` and `list-assignments`. Each subcommand has options for listing active or inactive entities, providing a straightforward way to manage and view information.

### Subcommand 1: `list-courses`
- **Options**: `--active/--no-active` 
  - Default: `--active` (lists only active courses).
  - Use `--no-active` to list inactive courses as well.
  
### Subcommand 2: `list-assignments`
- **Arguments**: Course name
- **Options**: `--active/--no-active`
  - Default: `--active` (lists only active assignments).
  - Use `--no-active` to list inactive assignments as well.
  
If an exact match for the course name is not found, the program searches for a course with the provided substring. In case of multiple matches, it informs the user and lists the matching courses.

The assignments listed include:
- Assignment name
- Due date

### Security Note: Token Handling
You must pass a **Canvas API token** securely using the `--token` option. **Do not include your token in the code**â€”this ensures the token is not exposed in version control (e.g., GitHub). Failing to adhere to this may lead to security risks.

### Build System
We used **Maven** for project build and dependency management. Ensure that the project compiles successfully before submission to avoid penalties, as non-compiling submissions will not be graded.

### Example CLI Runs

```bash
# List active courses
$ java -jar cli.jar list-courses --token <your-token> --active

# List inactive assignments for a specific course
$ java -jar cli.jar list-assignments "Introduction to GraphQL" --token <your-token> --no-active
